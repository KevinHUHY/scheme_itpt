1. local define should not be allowed, ohterwise, closure will be broken
2. introduce BoolCell type, need to change parser
3. add support for let expression
4. inside eval_lambda: analysis body to identify free variables
//5. function name and variable name cannot be the same, they are currently using the namespace
6. variable name will shallow function name
(solved) 7. why cout << *op << doesn't work????
8. redefine shouldn't be allowed
9. optimize the representation of environment, calc free variable
10. write a short summary for dynamic scope, static scope, and closure
11. add support to macro definition
12. this should be allowed. i.e. 'a' doesn't have to be defined forward. same as the syntax in python, where forward declaration is not needed.
    (define (f x) (+ a x))
    (define a 2)
